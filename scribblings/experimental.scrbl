Unlike the preceding, features documented in this section are experimental
and/or under development and are subject to breaking changes without notice.

I obviously don't intend to break things gratuitously, but I suggest that before
using these features in production code you check with me about their status
or, in the worst-case scenario, fork the library.

@defform[(in-match val-expr pat ...+)]{
 A rather unusual form of sequence syntax which is only valid
 directly in a @racket[for]-clause.
 Using @racket[in-match] creates a single-element, potentially-multi-valued
 sequence, somewhat like @racket[in-value*/expression], but its peculiar
 characteristics make it better thought of as a way of turning a @racket[for]-clause
 into a binding form like @racket[let-values] or @racket[match-define].

 The @racket[val-expr] is an expression, and each @racket[pat] is a pattern
 for @racket[match]: these are tried against the value of @racket[val-expr]
 in the usual way. Each @racket[pat] must bind all of the identifiers bound
 by the @racket[for]-clause, or an unbound identifier error will occur.
 The @racket[for]-clause identifiers are bound to the values assosciated
 with them by the first @racket[pat] which matches successfully.

 Conceptually, the following @racket[for] forms written using @racket[in-match]
 and @racket[in-value*/expression] are equivalent:
 @racketblock[
 (for ([(rslt-id ...) (in-match val-expr pat ...+)])
   for-body ...+)
 (for ([(rslt-id ...) (in-value*/expression
                       (match val-expr
                         [pat
                          (values rslt-id ...)]
                         ...))])
   for-body ...+)]

 Asside from brevity, the key advantage of @racket[in-match] is that
 it installs the values of the @racket[rslt-id]s based on their names,
 eliminating the requirement of getting them in the right order
 in every @racket[match] clause, as one must with @racket[in-value*/expression].

 @examples[#:eval (make-adjutor-eval)
           (for*/list ([spec `([3 4 5]
                               [10 20])]
                       [(a b c) (in-match spec
                                          (list a b c)
                                          (list a (and b c)))])
             (+ a b c))
           (eval:error
            (for/first ([(x y) (in-match '(1 2)
                                         (list x z))])
              (+ x y)))]
}

@defform[(define/check-args function-header body ...+)]{
 Like the function form of @racket[define], but actually defines a macro that
 statically checks the number (and keywords) of arguments before expanding to
 an application of the underlying function. The @racket[function-header]
 uses the same syntax as @racket[define] (including curried functions, rest arguments,
 etc.), except that a plain identifier is dissalowed, as @racket[define/check-args]
 must be able to determine the required arguments at compile time.

 The resulting function can still be used as a first-class value, but checking
 only occurs for statically visible uses.

 @examples[#:eval (make-adjutor-eval)
           (eval:error
            (define/check-args (recur arg)
              (cond
                [(pair? arg)
                 (println (car arg))
                 (code:comment "Oops! Forgot the arguments ...")
                 (recur)] 
                [else
                 arg])))]
}

@defform[(define/check-args/contract function-header contract-expr body ...+)
         #:contracts ([contract-expr contract?])]{
 Like @racket[define/check-args], but the resulting function is additionally
 protected by the contract @racket[contract-expr].
 Unlike @racket[define/contract], blame is assigned to the module where
 the function is used (not necessarily the module where it is defined),
 facilitating the export of the identifier bound by @racket[define/check-args/contract].
}

@defform[(delay/thread/eager-errors option ... body ...+)
         #:grammar ([option
                     (code:line #:pred pred)
                     (code:line #:handler handler)])
         #:contracts ([pred (-> any/c any/c)]
                      [handler (-> any/c any)])]{
 Like @racket[(delay/thread body ...)], but, if
 forcing the promise would raise an exception
 satisfying @racket[pred] (which defaults to @racket[exn:fail?]),
 @racket[handler] (which defaults to @racket[raise])
 is called on the exception immediately in a background thread,
 without waiting for a call to @racket[force].
 Note that forcing a promise which raised such an exception
 still re-raises the exception as usual.

 Note that, because @racket[handler] is called in a new thread,
 catching such exceptions can be subtle.

 @examples[#:eval (make-adjutor-eval)
           (require racket/promise)
           (force (delay/thread/eager-errors 42))
           (define example-promise
             (with-handlers ([exn:fail? (位 (e) (displayln "Never gets here."))])
               (delay/thread/eager-errors (error 'example))))
           (code:comment "The background-raised exception doesn't show well in Scribble.")
           (code:comment "Try this at the REPL.")
           example-promise
           (eval:error (force example-promise))]
 @;{(define th
  (thread (位 ()
  (define th
  (current-thread))
  (delay/thread/eager-errors
  #:handler (位 (e)
  (eprintf "Caught an error. Breaking.")
  (break-thread th))
  (error 'caught))
  (sleep 1)
  (displayln "Never gets here."))))
  (thread-wait th)]}
}

@section{Structures}

@defform[(struct/derived
          (error-id orig-form ...)
          id maybe-super (field ...)
          struct-option ...)
         #:grammar ([maybe-super (code:line) super-id])]{
 Defines a new structure type like @racket[struct], but
 with syntax errors reported in terms of @racket[(error-id orig-form ...)]
 like @racket[define-struct/derived].

 See @racket[struct] for the grammar of @racket[field]
 and @racket[struct-option].
}

@defform[(structure id maybe-super (field ...)
           option ...)
         #:grammar ([maybe-super (code:line) super-id]
                    [option structure-option restricted-struct-option]
                    [structure-option
                     (code:line #:constructor-contract contract-expr)
                     (code:line #:constructor constructor-wrapper-expr)
                     (code:line #:match-expander new-match-transformer)])
         #:contracts
         ([contract-expr contract?]
          [constructor-wrapper-expr contract-expr]
          [new-match-transformer
           (code:line (-> syntax? syntax?) (code:comment "in the transformer environment"))])]{
 In the simplest case, when no @racket[structure-option]s are
 given, defines a new structure type like @racket[struct],
 where a @racket[restricted-struct-option] is any option that can be given to
 @racket[struct] except for @racket[#:constructor-name],
 @racket[#:extra-constructor-name], @racket[#:name], and @racket[#:extra-name].

 Any @racket[structure-option]s that are given control the meaning of @racket[id].

 If a @racket[#:constructor] option is given, the @racket[constructor-wrapper-expr]
 is accessed instead of the default constructor when @racket[id] is used as an
 expression. The @racket[constructor-wrapper-expr] must satisfy the
 contract @racket[contract-expr] if a @racket[#:constructor-contract] option is given;
 otherwise, it is required to be a procedure. Inside the @racket[constructor-wrapper-expr],
 @racket[raw-constructor] can be used to access the default constructor.

 If a @racket[#:constructor-contract] option is given without a
 @racket[#:constructor] option, the default constructor is protected with
 the contract @racket[contract-expr].
 
 If a @racket[#:match-expander] clause is given, the @racket[new-match-transformer]
 must be an expression in the transformer environment that produces a function from
 syntax to syntax. It is used instead of the default pattern-matching behavior when
 @racket[id] is used as a
 @tech[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{match expander}.
 Inside the @racket[new-match-transformer], @racket[raw-match-transformation]
 can be used to implement transformers that expand to the default pattern-matching
 behavior.

 As with @racket[struct], @racket[id] can be used as a structure type transformer
 which can be used to define subtypes and cooperates with @racket[shared],
 @racket[struct-out], etc. (But note that a @racket[#:match-expander] clause
 contols @racket[id]'s cooperation with @racket[match].) For more detailed
 information about these uses of @racket[id], see
 @secref["structinfo" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")].

@section{Extending @racket[require-provide]}

The bindings in this section are provided @racket[for-syntax]
to be used in implementing extensions to @racket[require-provide].
They are particularly experimental and subject to change.

@defstruct*[simple-require-provide-transformer
            ([proc (-> syntax? syntax?)])]{
 A @racket[simple-require-provide-transformer] contains a function @racket[proc]
 (perhaps created @racket[syntax-parser]) that specifies a simple
 macro-like rewrite rule. Like a macro, @racket[proc] is called with the
 parenthesized form beginning with the identifier
 bound to the transformer itself. Its result must be a
 @racket[require-provide-spec].
}

@defstruct*[require-provide-transformer
            ([proc (-> syntax?
                       (values syntax? syntax?))])]{
 A @racket[require-provide-transformer] is like a 
 @racket[simple-require-provide-transformer], but more general.
 Its @racket[proc] returns two syntax objects: the first must be a valid
 @racket[require-spec] for use with @racket[require], and the second must
 be a @racket[provide-spec] for use with @racket[provide].
}

@deftogether[(@defidform[#:kind "syntax class" module-path]
               @defidform[#:kind "syntax class" phase-level])]{
 Syntax classes recognizing the grammer for module paths and phase levels as
 specified by @racket[require] and @racket[provide].
}

@defidform[#:kind "syntax class" require-provide-spec]{
 A syntax class recognizing the grammar documented under @racket[require-provide],
 including @racket[derived-require-provide-spec]s created with
 @racket[require-provide-transformer] or @racket[simple-require-provide-transformer].
 It has two attributes @racket[require-stx] and @racket[provide-stx], which
 are the syntax to be passed on to @racket[require] and @racket[provide], respectively.
