Adjutor is a library of (mostly) small, useful utilities
that I have found myself wanting in many different projects.

Most of this library should be regarded as stable (I rely on it
as stable in a number of different projects), but those portions
documented under @secref["Experimental"]
are, as one might guess, experimental and/or under development.

Bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome via email
or on @hyperlink["https://github.com/LiberalArtist/adjutor"]{GitHub}.

 Functions that concatenate their arguments into a regular expression value.
 A @racket[handler], if given, used as with @racket[regexp] etc.
 
 As a special case, in an application visible at compile-time
 when every @racket[arg] is a literal string or byte string, the regular
 expression value is generated at compile time rather than runtime.
 In this case, any @racket[handler] expression is not even evaluated:
 instead, a compile-time error is raised if the arguments are invalid.

 These functions are particularly designed for use with the
 @secref["reader" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/scribble/scribble.scrbl")].
}

@defform[(infix: left op right)]{
 Provides infix notation for binary operators, expanding to
 @racket[(op left right)].

 Infix notation is often useful, especially for noncommutative
 binary operators like @racket[<].
 Racket supports reader-based infix notation by default,
 so you can write @racket[(1 . < . 2)].
 However, a disadvantage of this notation for those used to reading
 Racket syntax is that the beginning of the s-expression doesn't
 make it obvious that infix notation is being used.
 This is particularly a problem when the expression immediately
 following the @litchar{(} is more complex than @racket[1], as
 it might be confused with a function or macro application.

 This macro provides an alternative infix notation specialized for
 the common case of binary operators, allowing the above expression
 to be written as @racket[(infix: 1 < 2)].
}

@defform[(define-alias new-id orig-id)]{
 Short for @racket[(define-syntax new-id (make-rename-transformer #'orig-id))]
}

@defform[(define-aliases [new-id orig-id] ...+)]{
 Short for multiple @racket[define-alias] forms.
}

@defform[(define* define-lhs maybe-with-clause body ...+)
         #:grammar ([maybe-with-clause
                     (code:line)
                     (code:line #:with [definition-or-expr ...])])]{
 The function form of @racket[define] helps with readability,
 but it doesn't work well for functions that want to maintain
 private state via a "let-over-lambda". Also, when
 binding a plain identifier with @racket[define], it is a syntax
 error to have "multiple expressions after identifier". These
 limitations are solved with @racket[define*].

 When the @racket[#:with] clause is ommited, @racket[define*] works
 just like @racket[define], except that multiple @racket[body]
 forms are allways allowed. (As usual, these can be arbitrary
 definitions and expressions, but they must end with an expression.)

 If a @racket[#:with] clause is given, it may contain arbitrary
 definitions and expressions (and may conclude with a definition).
 These are lifted outside the function, if applicable, and any
 identifiers defined in the @racket[#:with] clause are only in
 scope within the @racket[define*] form. If @racket[define-lhs]
 specifies a curried function, the @racket[#:with] clause
 is evaluated outside of the outermost function.

           (define* (add-to-base n)
             #:with [(define base

 @racket[define].

@defproc[(in-value* [expr any/c] ...)
         (and/c sequence? in-value*-record?)]{
 Produces a sequence which is similar to those produced by @racket[in-value]
 in that it has only a single element; however, whereas @racket[in-value]
 produces single-valued sequences, the sequence produced by @racket[in-value*]
 has as many values as there are @racket[expr] expressions.

 In other words, if @racket[in-value] is "useful for @racket[let]-like bindings in forms
 such as @racket[for*/list]", @racket[in-value*] is useful for
 @racket[let-values]-like bindings.

               @defproc[(in-value*-record? [v any/c]) any/c])]{
 The function @racket[in-value*/generator] creates a single-element,
 potentially-multi-valued sequence like @racket[in-value*],
 where the values are determined by @racket[generator].
 If @racket[generator] is a thunk, the values are the results of calling @racket[generator].
 Otherwise, @racket[generator] must be a sequence constructed using
 @racket[in-value*], @racket[in-value*/expression], or @racket[in-value*/generator],
 in which case @racket[generator] is returned directly (but potentially with
 a performance advantage when used directly in a @racket[for] clause).
 Sequences that may be used for @racket[generator] are recognized by the predicate
 @racket[in-value*-record?].

@defform[(in-value*/expression body-expr)]{
 Creates a sequence that is conceptually equivalent to
 @racket[(in-value*/generator (λ () body-expr))].
 Note that this means that @racket[body-expr] is evaluated each time
 the resulting sequence is 
 @tech[#:key "initiate" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{
  initiated}.
 
 @(performance-note in-value*/expression) Using @racket[in-value*/expression]
 may also have advantages over @racket[in-value*/generator] in such cases.

@defform[(provide-only module-path ...)]{
 The @racket[provide-only] form cooperates with @racket[require-provide]
 to export all bindings from each @racket[module-path], which should have been
 used in a @racket[require] form elsewhere.

 This might be desireable when a module is re-exporting bindings from a number of
 other modules via @racket[require-provide], but also wants to export bindings from
 some module which it had to import via @racket[require], perhaps because that
 module gave it the @racket[require-provide] binding itself.
 Thus, for example,
 @racketblock[(require adjutor)
              (require-provide (provide-only adjutor))]
 could be used as an alternative to
 @racketblock[(require adjutor)
              (provide (all-from-out adjutor))]

 Use of @racket[provide-only] outside of a @racket[require-provide] form
 is a syntax error.
