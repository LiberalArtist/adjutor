Parsing the PATH on Windows:

This says "s are required for paths that contain spaces:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/ee692671(v=technet.10)

This says they're optional, but implies they might be
able to be used to escape semicolons:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060929-06/?p=29533
(n.b. there is no escaping in the PATH on Unix)

What about paths that contain "?
